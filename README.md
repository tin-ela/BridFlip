# Flappy Bird game  

This is a project I took on to better understand the different components of a game. I worked alongside a tutorial to complete this project.
## Description

I used the assets from https://github.com/zigurous/unity-flappy-bird-tutorial/tree/main/Assets, as my main priority was understanding components and elements rather than stylising. I find that this experience was helpful, I took note of what I missed out on in my previous work and what else I want to know more about and explore in future projects. 

## Getting Started

I work on a windows 10, this project also uses unity and C# script. 

### Installing

I've pushed the entire project into git hub, feel free to explore and open files. 

## Authors
I used assets from https://github.com/zigurous/unity-flappy-bird-tutorial/tree/main/Assets and followed the set by step guide from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihvBiJ1oC9U&list=PLcZYmeTR9FWcK3XPaR1jFMGpldgcE0n8q&index=2.
